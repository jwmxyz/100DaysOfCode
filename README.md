# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: 21/11/2018

**Today's Progress**:

* Began reading NoSQL Distilled by Pramod J. Sadalage to gain insight if NoSQL is the correct approach for my project
* Implemented preact-router on my test application.

**Thoughts:**

* need to understand the difference between `import {entity} from ..` and `import entity from ..`
* Routing on single page applications through components seems the be a good idea for small based web API solutions.
* The power of NoSQL clusters seems to be the future with the vast amounts of data that is being collected.

### Day 1: 20/11/2018

**Today's Progress**: 

* Set-up NPM on laptop, installed preact and [(P)react Fluid](https://ajainvivek.github.io/preact-fluid/ "Preact Fluid")
* Created a simple application and and called in a simple component element.

**Thoughts:** 

* Props are incredibly overpowered. 
* Need to get the way vue.js works out of my head.
* Need to look into routing.
* Need to look into webpack.

**Link to work:** I'll link when I have something substantial.
