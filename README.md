# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 5: 24/11/2018

**Todays Progress**

* Worked on login page using css

**Thoughts**

* CSS looks good when you do a number of small features.
* A lot of new properties have been added since I properly last looked at css.
* Starting to appreciate small tweaks make a big difference.

### Day 4: 23/11/2018

**Todays Progress**

* Read more about WebPack and the implementation of rules
* Began building using SASS over just using and exisiting css framework.

**Thoughts**

* SASS is easier than I originally thought.
* WebPack is a beautiful powerful tool that I should have used earlier.
* Need to think more in depth about folder structure of files.

### Day 3: 22/11/2018

**Today's Progress**

* Lots of reading - mainly WebPack and more NoSql Distilled.
*   Understand the differences between `default exports` and `named exports`
* Restarted another test project from scratch implementing webpack
* Decided to move forward with preact without the dependencies of react - this could be interesting. Pure Preact FTW!

**Thoughts:**

* Slow down and learn thing slightly more in depth.
* Also make sure to use up to date information. The days of `babel-loader-es2015` are long gone! Google sort your indexing!

### Day 2: 21/11/2018

**Today's Progress**:

* Began reading NoSQL Distilled by Pramod J. Sadalage to gain insight if NoSQL is the correct approach for my project
* Implemented preact-router on my test application.

**Thoughts:**

* need to understand the difference between `import {entity} from ..` and `import entity from ..`
* Routing on single page applications through components seems the be a good idea for small based web API solutions.
* The power of NoSQL clusters seems to be the future with the vast amounts of data that is being collected.

### Day 1: 20/11/2018

**Today's Progress**: 

* Set-up NPM on laptop, installed preact and [(P)react Fluid](https://ajainvivek.github.io/preact-fluid/ "Preact Fluid")
* Created a simple application and and called in a simple component element.

**Thoughts:** 

* Props are incredibly overpowered. 
* Need to get the way vue.js works out of my head.
* Need to look into routing.
* Need to look into webpack.

**Link to work:** I'll link when I have something substantial.
